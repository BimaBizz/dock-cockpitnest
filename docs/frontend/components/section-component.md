# Section

The `SectionComponent` is a layout component used to create a section of a page with customizable styling and content. It acts as a container for other components, which are rendered within the section. The component utilizes a `ComponentRenderer` to handle the rendering of nested components, allowing for a flexible and modular layout. The `remove` prop controls whether the section should be displayed.

## Props

-   **data:** An object containing the section configuration.
    -   **class:** Additional CSS classes to apply to the section container for custom styling.
-   **children:** An array of component objects that will be rendered within the section.
    -   **id:** A unique identifier for the component.
    -   **component:** The type of component to render, managed by `ComponentRenderer`.
-   **remove:** A boolean that determines whether the section should be rendered or not. If `true`, the section will not be displayed.

## Component Code

```js title="src/components/availableComponents/SectionComponent.js"

import ComponentRenderer from '../ComponentRenderer';

const SectionComponent = ({ data, children, remove }) => (
  remove ? null : (
    <section className={`p-4 ${data.class}`}>
      {children.map((child) => (
        <ComponentRenderer key={child.id} component={child} />
      ))}
    </section>
  )
);

export default SectionComponent;
```
## Component Explanation

-   **Section Container:**
    
    -   The `SectionComponent` renders a `<section>` element with customizable padding and additional CSS classes. This allows you to define a distinct area on the page for content organization and styling.
-   **Child Rendering:**
    
    -   The `children` prop is an array of components that are rendered within the section. Each child component is passed to the `ComponentRenderer`, which handles the dynamic rendering based on the component type.
-   **ComponentRenderer Integration:**
    
    -   The `ComponentRenderer` is used to render each child component within the section. This enables modular content rendering and supports various component types dynamically.
-   **Visibility Control:**
    
    -   The section's visibility is controlled by the `remove` prop. If `remove` is `true`, the component returns `null`, and the section is not rendered.

## Customization

You can customize the `SectionComponent` by:

-   Adjusting the `data.class` prop to apply different styles and layouts to the section.
-   Modifying the `children` array to include different components and content within the section.
-   Using the `remove` prop to conditionally render the section based on specific application logic or user interactions.

## Use Cases

-   **Content Organization:** Useful for grouping related content and organizing sections within a page, such as headers, content blocks, and footers.
-   **Modular Layouts:** Ideal for creating modular layouts where different sections can be dynamically rendered based on configuration data.
-   **Custom Styling:** Allows for custom styling and padding to create visually distinct sections on the page.
