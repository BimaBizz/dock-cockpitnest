# Richtext

The `RichtextComponent` is a versatile component that allows you to render rich text content as HTML within your Next.js application. It takes preformatted HTML content as input and inserts it directly into the DOM, making it ideal for displaying complex content such as articles, blog posts, or content blocks. The component also provides the ability to conditionally render the content based on the `remove` prop.

## Props

-   **html:** A string containing HTML content that will be rendered inside the component.
-   **remove:** A boolean that determines whether the rich text content should be rendered or not. If `true`, the content will not be displayed.

## Component Code

```js title="src/components/availableComponents/RichtextComponent.js"
const RichtextComponent = ({ html, remove }) => (
    remove ? null : <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} className="richtext" />
);

export default RichtextComponent;
```
## Component Explanation

-   **Rendering HTML Content:**
    
    -   The `RichtextComponent` renders the provided HTML content using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute. This allows you to inject raw HTML into the DOM, which is useful for displaying rich text content that may include formatting, links, images, or other HTML elements.
-   **Class Name for Styling:**
    
    -   The content is wrapped in a `div` with the class name `richtext`. This class can be styled in your CSS to apply specific styles to the rich text content, ensuring consistency with the overall design of your application.
-   **Visibility Control:**
    
    -   The component's visibility is controlled by the `remove` prop. If `remove` is `true`, the component returns `null`, and the rich text content is not rendered. This feature is useful when you need to dynamically hide or show the content.

## Customization

You can customize the `RichtextComponent` by:

-   Adjusting the `html` prop to render different rich text content.
-   Modifying the `className` or adding additional CSS classes to the `div` container to apply custom styles.
-   Leveraging the `remove` prop to control the visibility of the rich text content based on specific conditions in your application.

## Use Cases

-   **Content Management Systems:** The `RichtextComponent` is particularly useful in scenarios where content is managed through a CMS and rendered dynamically in your application.
-   **Blog Posts and Articles:** Ideal for rendering rich text articles or blog posts with various HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
-   **Custom Content Blocks:** Allows for the easy creation of custom content blocks that can be reused across different pages or sections of your application.
